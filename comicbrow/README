comicbrow requires imagemagick, avfs, unrar and nodejs (>=0.4)
And also node modules: mime, imagemagick

Notes:

Imagemagick node module may not be able to scale some of the bigger images, to
fix, open node_modules/imagemagick/imagemagick.js and increase maxBuffers to
e.g. 1500*1024 (would be nice if this could be done from the code).

avfs doesn't work with unrar free version, unrar-nonfree is available from
example ubuntu multiverse. Adding support for free would be a matter of editing
a shellscript but avfs is getting a bit old and once libarchive gets it's rar
support finished I'll probably move to that.
